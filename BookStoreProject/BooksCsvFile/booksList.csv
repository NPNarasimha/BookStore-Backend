13,The Dark Room,Narayan,R. K. Narayan (1906—2001) witnessed nearly a century of change in his native India and captured it in fiction of uncommon warmth and vibrancy. In The Dark Room, Narayan’s portrait of aggrieved domesticity, the docile and obedient Savitri, like many Malgudi women, is torn between submitting to her husband’s humiliations and trying to escape them. Written during British rule, this novel brings colonial India into intimate focus through the narrative gifts of this master of literary realism.,1000,350,10,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-bVnAiFIwtUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE72CGWxMsMeYwCzRKF35UFS4VkRQYAyHE7vCEh6q4o99nAP3_h8aQ14yXUa_nEuFw8JdABFFBjT3NZxwvDT9qy9d7XFI9ZaCtGMISfvgaqo1_n6nyO_f05BdRp2bhKaC9vSZ3IRj&source=gbs_api,5,2022-01-10T12:06:34.065Z,2022-01-11T04:08:52.972Z
